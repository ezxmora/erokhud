# Er√∏kHUD

This is still half done :)

- Customizable colors
- Toggleable transparent viewmodels
- Toggleable friendlist (via file editing)
- Hitmarker
- Velocimeter

## Customization
This [folder](/#customizations) contains most of toggleable HUD features, everything is foolproof. If you want to change the main color of the HUD, simply go to [this file](/resource/schemes/colors_scheme.res#L5-L6) and edit **ehAccentColor** and **ehAccentTransparentColor** using [RGBA](https://rgbacolorpicker.com/) values. As a personal recommendation, I wouldn't mess the alpha values (255 and 150 respectively) also I wouldn't mess with the other colors since they get used for another components.
